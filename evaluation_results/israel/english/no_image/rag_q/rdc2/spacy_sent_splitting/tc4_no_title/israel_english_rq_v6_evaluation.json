Later on, he completed a five-year residency in Orthopaedics and Traumatology with a thesis on the treatment of leg fractures in athletes. He also completed a second four-year residency program in Sports Medicine at the University of Genoa where he presented a thesis on physiological characteristics of motorcycle riders."

Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous cardiac abnormalities, including cardiac rhythm disturbances (such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia), inadequate coronary artery blood flow (such as myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction), and electrolyte disturbances (such as hypokalemia and hyperkalemia). In a conventional 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on the patient's limbs and on the surface of the chest."

As a protective reflex, coughing can be repetitive with the cough reflex following three phases: an inhalation, a forced exhalation against a closed glottis, and a violent release of air from the lungs following opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound. Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Many viruses and bacteria benefit, from an evolutionary perspective, by causing the host to cough, which helps to spread the disease to new hosts."

Causes of pain around the hip joint may be intra-articular, extra-articular, or referred pain from neighboring structures, such as sacroiliac joint, spine, symphysis pubis, or the inguinal canal. Common etiologies include: \nBULLET::::- Trochanteric bursitis, caused by inflammation of the trochanteric bursa of the outer hip, often affecting both hips\nBULLET::::- Arthritis of the hip, degeneration of the hip joint from osteonecrosis, trauma, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, or anatomic anomalies\nBULLET::::- Meralgia paresthetica, a chronic neurological disorder of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, most common among those who are pregnant or have diabetes\nBULLET::::- Hip avascular necrosis, cell death of bone tissue in the hip joint brought on by vascular occlusion or coagulation which is the result of old age, alcoholism, trauma, decompression sickness, or several other possible causes; the treatment is often total hip replacement\nBULLET::::- Occult hip fracture, a fine crack somewhere in the hip socket, common in elderly women and those with osteoporosis, usually only in one hip\nBULLET::::- Snapping hip, a condition caused by iliotibial band snap, iliopsoas tendon snap, and hip labral tear, usually only in one hip; may be accompanied by an audible \"snap\" when the hip joint is moved\nBULLET::::- Paget's disease, enlarged or deformed bones of the hip, a genetic disorder; pain is usually in both hips simultaneously\nBULLET::::- Malignancy, as cancer in the pelvis or proximal femur may cause pain; usually only one hip is affected\nBULLET::::- Primary septic arthritis caused by an infection within the synovial fluid of the hip, a condition rare in adults except for those who are already immunocompromised as well as those who have artificial hips; only one side of the pelvis is affected, onset of pain is rapid\nBULLET::::- Transient or accute synovitis or \"irritable hip\", a condition most common in children, more often in boys than girls, and clearing up on its own within 7\u201310 days; pain is only on one side\nBULLET::::- Sciatica, a condition most often brought on by damage to the L4 or L5 nerve roots but sometimes caused by inflammation or tension in the piriformis muscle of the pelvis (which rests on the sciatic nerve), in which case the condition is called piriformis syndrome; pain usually only occurs in one side but may occur in the other side at other times or (rarely) both sides simultaneously\nBULLET::::- Sacroiliac joint dysfunction, an uncommon neurological condition of the mostly-immobile sacroiliac joint of the hip brought on by previous trauma to the joint such as an automobile accident; pain will usually be in only one side\nBULLET::::- Radiculopathy, a nerve disorder brought on by pressure or irritation of a nerve at its root (i.e., near the spine) often resulting from degeneration of a spinal disc, joint degeneration, or osteoarthritis, among other causes\nPain in the groin, called \"anterior hip pain\", is most often the result of osteoarthritis, osteonecrosis, occult fracture, acute synovitis, and septic arthritis; pain on the sides of the hip, called \"lateral hip pain\", is usually caused by bursitis; pain in the buttock, called \"posterior\" or \"gluteal hip pain\", which is the least common type of hip pain, is most often caused by sacroiliac joint dysfunction as well as sciatica (whether from a hemorrhaged spinal disk or a tense piriformis muscle)."

Individuals with autoimmune hepatitis often have no initial symptoms and the disease is detected by abnormal liver function tests.

Since the question of \"true causality\" is deeply philosophical, and because of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy of assuming that one thing preceding another can be used as a proof of causation, econometricians assert that the Granger test finds only \"predictive causality\". A time series \"X\" is said to Granger-cause \"Y\" if it can be shown, usually through a series of t-tests and F-tests on lagged values of \"X\" (and with lagged values of \"Y\" also included), that those \"X\" values provide statistically significant information about future values of\u00a0\"Y\"."

This is because the thick peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell wall retains the stain after it is washed away from the rest of the sample, in the decolorization stage of the test.

The possible existence of unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times, such as in Jain scriptures from 6th century BC India and the 1st century BC book \"On Agriculture\" by Marcus Terentius Varro. The scientific study of microorganisms began with their observation under the microscope in the 1670s by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur found that microorganisms caused food spoilage, debunking the theory of spontaneous generation."
