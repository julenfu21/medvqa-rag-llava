Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, \"Helicobacter pylori\" infection, hepatitis C, obesity and Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL, there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging."

Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes."

It is taken by mouth and has an effect that lasts for at least a day.\nCommon side effects include swelling, feeling tired, abdominal pain, and nausea. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure or heart attack. Whether use is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding is unclear. When used by people with liver problems, and in elderly individuals, doses should be reduced. Amlodipine works partly by increasing the size of arteries.

Occasionally onset of symptoms is gradual.\nThe cause of pericarditis is believed to be most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, uremic pericarditis, following a heart attack, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and chest trauma. The cause often remains unknown. Diagnosis is based on the chest pain, a pericardial rub, specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and fluid around the heart.

The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often present without chest pain and instead have neck pain, arm pain or feel tired. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest."

It is characterized by repeated episodes of lip and eyelid edema and occasionally euthyroid goiter. The syndrome generally occurs within the first 20 years of life. About 100 cases had been described by 1998.\n\nBULLET::::- Blepharochalasis : Recurrent episodes of swelling cause stretching and atrophy of the upper eyelid skin. This results in the relaxation of the tarsal fold allowing tissue to slack over the palpebral fissure. In severe cases, the lower eyelid is also involved.\nBULLET::::- Double Upper Lip : Swelling causes duplication between the inner and outer parts of the upper lip. Occasionally the lower lip is involved.\nBULLET::::- Euthyroid Goiter : Occurs in 10% of cases. It is not usually associated with toxic symptoms. Goiter usually presents several years after initial eyelid and lip edema.\n\nCosmetic surgery"
