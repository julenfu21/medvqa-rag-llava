In its early stage, called gingivitis, the gums become swollen, red, and may bleed. In its more serious form, called periodontitis, the gums can pull away from the tooth, bone can be lost, and the teeth may loosen or fall out. Bad breath may also occur. \nPeriodontal disease is generally due to bacteria in the mouth infecting the tissue around the teeth. Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, family history, and certain medications. Diagnosis is by inspecting the gum tissue around the teeth both visually and with a probe and X-rays looking for bone loss around the teeth."

It almost always occurs in the bones of the lower leg and involves both epithelial and osteofibrous tissue.\n\nThe condition was first described by Fischer in 1913.\n\nPatients typically present with swelling with or without pain. The slow-growing tumor predominantly arises in long bones in a subcortical location (95% in the tibia or fibula). Most commonly, patients are in their second or third decade, but adamantinoma can occur over a wide age range.\n\nBenign osteofibrous dysplasia may be a precursor of adamantinoma or a regressive phase of adamantinoma.\n\nHistologically, islands of epithelial cells are found in a fibrous stroma. The tumor is typically well-demarcated, osteolytic and eccentric, with cystic zones resembling soap bubbles."

Before puberty, both sexes have roughly similar vocal pitch, but during puberty the male voice typically deepens an octave, while the female voice usually deepens only by a few tones.\n\nA similar effect is a voice crack, during which a person's voice suddenly and unintentionally enters a higher register (usually falsetto) for a brief period of time. This may be caused by singing or talking at a pitch outside the person's natural vocal range, stress, emotional tension, or the physical changes associated with puberty. An instance of a voice crack (when associated with puberty) lasts for only a moment and generally occurs less frequently as a person grows into maturity."

The most common mediastinal masses are neurogenic tumors (20% of mediastinal tumors), usually found in the posterior mediastinum, followed by thymoma (15\u201320%) located in the anterior mediastinum. Lung cancer typically spreads to the lymph nodes in the mediastinum.\n\nThe mediastinum has three main parts: the anterior mediastinum (front), the middle mediastinum, and the posterior mediastinum (back). Masses in the anterior portion of the mediastinum can include thymoma, lymphoma, pheochromocytoma, germ cell tumors including teratoma, thyroid tissue, and parathyroid lesions. Masses in this area are more likely to be malignant than those in other compartments."

Acute promyelocytic leukemia was first characterized in 1957 by French and Norwegian physicians as a hyperacute fatal illness, with a median survival time of less than a week. Today, prognoses have drastically improved; 10-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 80-90% according to one study.\n\nThe symptoms tend to be similar to AML in general with the following being possible symptoms:"

Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age. Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any vaginal bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have ovaries, menopause may be considered to have occurred at the time of the surgery or when their hormone levels fell. Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age."

This cycle results in the thickening of the lining of the uterus, and the growth of an egg, (which is required for pregnancy).

Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11\u00a0years, depending on the HIV subtype. In most cases, HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, and vaginal fluids. Research has shown (for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples) that HIV is untransmissable through condomless sexual intercourse if the HIV-positive partner has a consistently undetectable viral load. Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, during"

Complications may include a Bankart lesion, Hill-Sachs lesion, rotator cuff tear, or injury to the axillary nerve.\nA shoulder dislocation often occurs as a result of a fall onto an outstretched arm or onto the shoulder. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and confirmed by X-rays. They are classified as anterior, posterior, inferior, and superior with most being anterior.\nTreatment is by shoulder reduction which may be accomplished by a number of techniques. These include traction-countertraction, external rotation, scapular manipulation, and the Stimson technique. After reduction X-rays are recommended for verification. The arm may then be placed in a sling for a few weeks. Surgery may be recommended in those with recurrent dislocations."

The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation.

IRDS affects about 1% of newborns and is the leading cause of death in preterm infants. The incidence decreases with advancing gestational age, from about 50% in babies born at 26\u201328 weeks to about 25% at 30\u201331 weeks.

Common migraine treatments may help alleviate the carotidynia symptoms. Recent histological evidence has implicated an inflammatory component of carotidynia, but studies are limited. Carotid arteritis is a much less common cause of carotidynia, but has much more serious consequences. It is a form of giant cell arteritis, which is a condition that usually affects arteries in the head. Due to this serious condition possibly causing carotidynia, and the possibility that neck pain is related to some other non-carotidynia and serious condition, the case should be investigated by a medical doctor.

The hearing loss is most marked at higher frequencies. Hearing loss that accumulates with age but is caused by factors other than normal aging (nosocusis and sociocusis) is not presbycusis, although differentiating the individual effects of distinct causes of hearing loss can be difficult.\n\nThe cause of presbycusis is a combination of genetics, cumulative environmental exposures and pathophysiological changes related to aging.
