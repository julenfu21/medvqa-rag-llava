Injuries occur commonly after automobile- or sports-related accidents. A blunt force is involved in 80-85% of injuries to the kidney. Major decelerations can result in major vascular injuries near the kidney's hilum. Gunshots and knife wounds commonly are the cause of penetrating injuries. Fractured ribs can result in penetrating injuries to the kidney."
