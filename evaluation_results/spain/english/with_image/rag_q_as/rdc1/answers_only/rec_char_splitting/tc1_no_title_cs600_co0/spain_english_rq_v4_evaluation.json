For the purposes of staging, the larynx is divided into three anatomical regions: the glottis (true vocal cords, anterior and posterior commissures); the supraglottis (epiglottis, arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds, and false cords); and the subglottis.\n\nMost laryngeal cancers originate in the glottis. Supraglottic cancers are less common, and subglottic tumours are least frequent."

Today, anti-histone antibodies are still used as a marker for systemic lupus erythematosus, but are also implicated in other autoimmune diseases like Sjogren's Syndrome, dermatomyositis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-histone antibodies can be used as a marker for drug-induced lupus."

It is a generally believed that MDA5 typically recognizes dsRNA over 2000nts in length, however it has been shown that whilst MDA5 can detect and bind to cytoplasmic dsRNA it is in fact activated by a high molecular weight RNA complex composed of ssRNA and dsRNA."
