Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness and trouble with sensation or coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially with the advancement of the disease."

It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones. Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is regarded as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct."

Over time, these T cells commonly spread throughout the mucosal lining of a portion of the GI tract (particularly the jejunum and ileum of the small intestine), lead to GI tract nodules and ulcerations, and cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, obstruction, bleeding, and/or perforation. In 2008, the World Health Organization defined a specific type of lymphoma, enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL), as having two different types: EATL type I, a lymphoma occurring in patients with the chronic, autoimmune GI tract disorder, celiac disease, and EATL type II, a similar bowel lymphoma that was not associated with celiac disease. However, subsequent studies found significant clinical, pathologic, and pathophysiological differences between these two types of lymphoma. Consequently, the World Health Organization (2016) redefined these lymphomas as separate entities, terming the celiac disease-associated lymphoma as enteropathy-associted T cell lymphoma (EATL) and the lymphoma not associated with celiac disease as monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T cell lymphoma (MEITL)."

It is a type of soft tissue sarcoma. The name \"synovial sarcoma\" was coined early in the 20th century, as some researchers thought that the microscopic similarity of some tumors to synovium, and its propensity to arise adjacent to joints, indicated a synovial origin; however, the actual cells from which the tumor develops are unknown and not necessarily synovial. Primary synovial sarcomas are most common in the soft tissue near the large joints of the arm and leg but have been documented in most human tissues and organs, including the brain, prostate, and heart. Synovial sarcoma occurs in about 1-2 per 1,000,000 people a year."

Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications outside the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer."

To remove a calculus, Civiale inserted his instrument through the urethra and bored holes in the stone."

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the susceptibility of organisms to systemic infection increased following exposure to ionizing radiation. The risk of systemic infection is higher when the organism has a combined injury, such as a conventional blast, thermal burn, or radiation burn. There is a direct quantitative relationship between the magnitude of the neutropenia that develops after exposure to radiation and the increased risk of developing infection. Because no controlled studies of therapeutic intervention in humans are available, almost all of the current information is based on animal research."

However, imaging parameters are chosen so as to maximize spatial resolution: a narrow slice width is used (usually 1\u20132\u00a0mm), a high spatial resolution image reconstruction algorithm is used, field of view is minimized, so as to minimize the size of each pixel, and other scan factors (e.g. focal spot) may be optimized for resolution at the expense of scan speed. Depending on the suspected diagnosis, the scan may be performed in both inspiration and expiration."
