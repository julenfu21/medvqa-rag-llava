First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, \"M. tuberculosis\" has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. This coating makes the cells impervious to Gram staining, and as a result, \"M. tuberculosis\" can appear either Gram-negative or Gram-positive. Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl-Neelsen, or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used instead to identify \"M. tuberculosis\" with a microscope. The"
