First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, \"M. tuberculosis\" has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. This coating makes the cells impervious to Gram staining, and as a result, \"M. tuberculosis\" can appear either Gram-negative or Gram-positive. Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl-Neelsen, or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used instead to identify \"M. tuberculosis\" with a microscope. The"

Cervical dilation may occur naturally, or may be induced surgically or medically. In the later stages of pregnancy, the cervix may already have opened up to 1\u20133\u00a0cm (or more in rarer circumstances), but during labor, repeated uterine contractions lead to further widening of the cervix to about 6 centimeters. From that point, pressure from the presenting part (head in vertex"

In 2015, there were about 135 million births globally. About 15 million were born before 37 weeks of gestation, while between 3 and 12 percent were born after 42 weeks. In the developed world most deliveries occur in hospitals, while in the developing world most births take place at home with the support of a traditional birth attendant."
