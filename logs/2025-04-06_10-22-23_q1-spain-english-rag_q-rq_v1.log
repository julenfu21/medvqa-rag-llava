Bariatric surgery

Bariatric surgery (or weight loss surgery) includes a variety of procedures performed on people who are obese. Long term weight loss through Standard of Care procedures (Roux en Y Bypass, Sleeve Gastrectomy, and Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch) is largely achieved by altering gut hormone levels that are responsible for hunger and satiety, leading to a new hormonal weight set point .

Bariatrics

Bariatrics is the branch of medicine that deals with the causes, prevention, and treatment of obesity. The term "bariatrics" was coined around 1965, from the Greek root "bar"- ("weight" as in barometer), suffix -"iatr" ("treatment," as in pediatrics), and suffix -"ic" ("pertaining to").

Gastric bypass surgery

Surgeons have developed several different ways to reconnect the intestine, thus leading to several different gastric bypass procedures (GBP).
