You are an AI assistant that answers multiple-choice questions by selecting exactly one letter: A, B, C, or D. Each question consists of BOTH an image and a text-based question. Carefully analyze them together to determine the correct answer. Additionally, relevant context is provided below inside <rag_docs>. This context should only be used if you cannot determine the answer directly from the image and question. Do not use any external knowledge beyond what is explicitly provided.

A gonimoblast is a type of cell produced by red algae upon the fertilization of a zygotic nucleus, and involved in the formation of carpospores. The cells subsequently divide and ultimately serve as storage or generative cells. Storage cells contain starch and are multinucleate; whereas generative cells are situated further from the auxiliary cell, are uninucleate, and form the terminal lobes in the ensuing carpospores. Gonimoblasts are connected by septal pore

The myeloblast is a unipotent stem cell which differentiates into the effectors of the granulocyte series. It is found in the bone marrow. Stimulation of myeloblasts by G-CSF and other cytokines triggers maturation, differentiation, proliferation and cell survival. Myeloblasts reside extravascularly in the bone marrow. Hematopoiesis takes place in the extravascular cavities between the sinuses of the marrow. The wall of the sinuses is composed of two different types of cells, endothelial cells and adventitial reticular cells. The hemopoietic cells are aligned

A spermatogonium (plural: "spermatogonia") is an undifferentiated male germ cell. Spermatogonia undergo spermatogenesis to form mature spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. There are three subtypes of spermatogonia in humans:
BULLET::::- Type A (dark) cells, with dark nuclei. These cells are reserve spermatogonial stem cells which do not usually undergo active mitosis.
