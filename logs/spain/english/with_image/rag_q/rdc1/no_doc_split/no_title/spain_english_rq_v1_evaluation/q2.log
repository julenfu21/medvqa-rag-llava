Question related to image no. 2: A 20-year-old man with a history of asthma presents with dysphagia and food impaction. An upper digestive endoscopy with esophageal biopsies is performed. What diagnosis is this proximal esophageal biopsy compatible with? A - Reflux esophagitis B - Barrett's esophagus C - Eosinophilic esophagitis D - Candida esophagitis

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD; ), also called by various other names, is a diagnostic endoscopic procedure that visualizes the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract down to the duodenum. It is considered a minimally invasive procedure since it does not require an incision into one of the major body cavities and does not require any significant recovery after the procedure (unless sedation or anesthesia has been used). However, a sore throat is common.

BULLET::::- Unexplained anemia (usually along with a colonoscopy)
BULLET::::- Upper gastrointestinal bleeding as evidenced by hematemesis or melena
BULLET::::- Persistent dyspepsia in patients over the age of 45 years
BULLET::::- Heartburn and chronic acid reflux – this can lead to a precancerous lesion called Barrett's esophagus
BULLET::::- Persistent emesis
BULLET::::- Dysphagia – difficulty in swallowing
BULLET::::- Odynophagia – painful swallowing
BULLET::::- Persistent nausea
BULLET::::- IBD (inflammatory bowel diseases)

BULLET::::- Surveillance of Barrett's esophagus
BULLET::::- Surveillance of gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer
BULLET::::- Occasionally after gastric surgery

BULLET::::- Abnormal barium swallow or barium meal
BULLET::::- Confirmation of celiac disease (via biopsy)

BULLET::::- Treatment (banding/sclerotherapy) of esophageal varices
BULLET::::- Injection therapy (e.g. epinephrine in bleeding lesions)
BULLET::::- Cutting off of larger pieces of tissue with a snare device (e.g. polyps, endoscopic mucosal resection)
BULLET::::- Application of cautery to tissues
BULLET::::- Removal of foreign bodies (e.g. food) that have been ingested
BULLET::::- Tamponade of bleeding esophageal varices with a balloon
BULLET::::- Application of photodynamic therapy for treatment of esophageal malignancies
BULLET::::- Endoscopic drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst
BULLET::::- Tightening the lower esophageal sphincter
BULLET::::- Dilating or stenting of stenosis or achalasia
BULLET::::- Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (feeding tube placement)
BULLET::::- Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) combines EGD with fluoroscopy
BULLET::::- Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) combines EGD with 5–12 MHz ultrasound imaging

BULLET::::- Endoscopic trans-gastric laparoscopy
BULLET::::- Placement of gastric balloons in bariatric surgery

The complication rate is about 1 in 1000. They include:

BULLET::::- aspiration, causing aspiration pneumonia
BULLET::::- bleeding
BULLET::::- perforation
BULLET::::- cardiopulmonary problems

Problems of gastrointestinal "function" are usually not well diagnosed by endoscopy since "motion" or "secretion" of the gastrointestinal tract are not easily inspected by EGD. Nonetheless, findings such as excess fluid or poor motion of the gut during endoscopy can be suggestive of disorders of function. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia are not diagnosed with EGD, but EGD may be helpful in excluding other diseases that mimic these common disorders.

The tip of the endoscope should be lubricated and checked for critical functions including: tip angulations, air and water suction, and image quality.

The patient is kept NPO (nil per os) or NBM (nothing by mouth) that is, told not to eat, for at least 4 hours before the procedure. Most patients tolerate the procedure with only topical anesthesia of the oropharynx using lidocaine spray. However, some patients may need sedation and the very anxious/agitated patient may even need a general anesthetic. Informed consent is obtained before the procedure. The main risks are bleeding and perforation. The risk is increased when a biopsy or other intervention is performed.

The patient lies on his/her left side with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the endoscope. The endoscope is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle manipulation under vision guides the endoscope into the esophagus. The endoscope is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The endoscope is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine the first and second parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the endoscope is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in order to examine the fundus and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the endoscope. Still photographs can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings.

In its most basic use, the endoscope is used to inspect the internal anatomy of the digestive tract. Often inspection alone is sufficient, but biopsy is a valuable adjunct to endoscopy. Small biopsies can be made with a pincer (biopsy forceps) which is passed through the scope and allows sampling of 1 to 3 mm pieces of tissue under direct vision. The intestinal mucosa heals quickly from such biopsies.

BULLET::::- Endoscope
BULLET::::- Non-coaxial optic fiber system to carry light to the tip of the endoscope
BULLET::::- A chip camera at the tip of the endoscope – this has now replaced the coaxial optic fibers of older scopes that were prone to damage and consequent loss of picture quality
BULLET::::- Air/water channel to clean the lens using the water and air channel for drying the lens itself and to insufflate the esophagus and the stomach during the operation to prevent from collapsing the track to better vision in the procedure
BULLET::::- Suction/Working channels – these may be in the form of one or more channels
BULLET::::- Control handle – this houses the controls
BULLET::::- Umbilical Cords that connected to the light source and video processor to supply the endoscope with suction and air pressure and water for (suction and irrigation process) and light to transmit in the body to deliver the video signal to the processor to show the live image on the monitor
BULLET::::- Stack
BULLET::::- Light source
BULLET::::- Suction
BULLET::::- Electrosurgical unit
BULLET::::- Video recorder/photo printer
BULLET::::- Instruments
BULLET::::- Biopsy forceps
BULLET::::- Snares
BULLET::::- Injecting needles
BULLET::::- Chemical agents
BULLET::::- Dimethicone
BULLET::::- Acetate
BULLET::::- Indigo carmine

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD or OGD) is also called panendoscopy (PES) and upper GI endoscopy. It is also often called just upper endoscopy, upper GI, or even just endoscopy; because EGD is the most commonly performed type of endoscopy, the ambiguous term "endoscopy" is sometimes informally used to refer to EGD by default. The term "gastroscopy" literally focuses on the stomach alone, but in practice the usage overlaps.

BULLET::::- Colonoscopy
BULLET::::- Transnasal esophagoscopy
