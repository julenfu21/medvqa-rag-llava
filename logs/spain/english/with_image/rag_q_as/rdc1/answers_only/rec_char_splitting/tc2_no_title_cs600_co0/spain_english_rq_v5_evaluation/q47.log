RAG block for ANSWERS:

A answer context:

A trochanter is tubercle of the femur near its joint with the hip bone. In humans and most mammals, the trochanters serve as important muscle attachment sites. Humans are known to have three trochanters, though the anatomic "normal" includes only the greater and lesser trochanters. (The third trochanter is not present in all specimens.)

'Trokhos' (Greek) = 'wheel', with reference to the spherical femoral head which was first named 'trokhanter'. Later usage came to include the femoral neck.

In human anatomy, the trochanter is a part of the femur. It can refer to: BULLET::::- Greater trochanter
BULLET::::- Lesser trochanter
BULLET::::- Third trochanter, which is occasionally present

BULLET::::- Fourth trochanter, of archosaur leg bones
BULLET::::- trochanter (arthropod leg), a segment of the arthropod leg

BULLET::::- Intertrochanteric crest
BULLET::::- Intertrochanteric line

B answer context:

Partialism is sexual interest with an exclusive focus on a specific part of the body other than the genitals. Partialism is categorized as a fetishistic disorder in the DSM-5 of the American Psychiatric Association only if it causes significant psychosocial distress for the person or has detrimental effects on important areas of their life. In the DSM-IV, it was considered a separate paraphilia (not otherwise specified), but was merged into fetishistic disorder by the DSM-5. Individuals who exhibit partialism sometimes describe the anatomy of interest to them as having equal or greater erotic attraction for them as do the genitals.

C answer context:

Internal fixation is an operation in orthopedics that involves the surgical implementation of implants for the purpose of repairing a bone, a concept that dates to the mid-nineteenth century and was made applicable for routine treatment in the mid-twentieth century. An internal fixator may be made of stainless steel, titanium alloy, or cobalt-chrome alloy.

Types of internal fixators include:
BULLET::::- Plate and screws
BULLET::::- Kirschner wires
BULLET::::- Intramedullary nails Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) involves the implementation of implants to guide the healing process of a bone, as well as the open reduction, or setting, of the bone. "Open reduction" refers to open surgery to set bones, as is necessary for some fractures. "Internal fixation" refers to fixation of screws and/or plates, intramedullary rods and other devices to enable or facilitate healing. Rigid fixation prevents micro-motion across lines of fracture to enable healing and prevent infection, which happens when implants such as plates (e.g. dynamic compression plate) are used. Open

D answer context:

Bed rest, also referred to as the rest-cure, is a medical treatment in which a person lies in bed for most of the time to try to cure an illness. Bed rest refers to voluntarily lying in bed as a treatment and not being confined to bed because of a health impairment which physically prevents leaving bed. The practice is still used although a 1999 systematic review found no benefits for any of the 17 conditions studied and no proven benefit for any conditions at all, beyond that imposed by symptoms. In the United States, nearly 20% of pregnant women have some degree of restricted activity prescribed despite the growing data showing it to be dangerous, causing some experts to call its use "unethical".

Extended bed rest has been proven to be a potentially harmful treatment needing more careful evaluation.

Women who are pregnant and are experiencing early labor, vaginal bleeding, and cervix complications have been prescribed bed rest. This practice in 2013 was strongly discouraged due to no evidence of benefit and evidence of potential harm.
