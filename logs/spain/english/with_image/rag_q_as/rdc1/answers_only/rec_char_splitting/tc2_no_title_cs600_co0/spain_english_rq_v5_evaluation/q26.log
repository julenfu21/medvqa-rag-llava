A answer context:

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (embolism). Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath, chest pain particularly upon breathing in, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present, such as a red, warm, swollen, and painful leg. Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, and sometimes a mild fever. Severe cases can lead to passing out, abnormally low blood pressure, and sudden death. PE usually results from a blood clot in the leg that travels to the lung. The risk of blood clots is increased by cancer, prolonged bed rest, smoking, stroke, certain genetic conditions, estrogen-based medication, pregnancy, obesity, and after some types of surgery. A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air, fat, or amniotic fluid. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in combination with test results. If the risk is low, a blood test known as a D-dimer may rule out the condition. Otherwise, a CT pulmonary angiography, lung ventilation/perfusion scan, or ultrasound of

B answer context:

Pulmonary edema is fluid accumulation in the tissue and air spaces of the lungs. It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause respiratory failure. It is due to either failure of the left ventricle of the heart to remove blood adequately from the pulmonary circulation (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or an injury to the lung parenchyma or vasculature of the lung (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly avoiding further damage to the lung. Pulmonary edema, especially acute, can lead to fatal respiratory distress or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. It is a cardinal feature of congestive heart failure. The term edema is from the Greek (oídēma, "swelling"), from οἰδέω (oidéō, "I swell").

C answer context:

Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is a form of lung disease characterized by progressive scarring of both lungs. The scarring (fibrosis) involves the supporting framework (interstitium) of the lung. UIP is thus classified as a form of interstitial lung disease. The term "usual" refers to the fact that UIP is the most common form of interstitial fibrosis. "Pneumonia" indicates "lung abnormality", which includes fibrosis and inflammation. A term previously used for UIP in the British literature is cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA), a term that has fallen out of favor since the basic underlying pathology is now thought to be fibrosis, not inflammation. The term usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) has also often been used, but again, the "-itis" part of that name may overemphasize inflammation.

D answer context:

Bronchopneumonia is a subtype of pneumonia. It is the acute inflammation of the bronchi, accompanied by inflamed patches in the nearby lobules of the lungs.

It is often contrasted with lobar pneumonia but in clinical practice the types are difficult to apply, as the patterns usually overlap. Bronchopneumonia (lobular) often leads to lobar pneumonia as the infection progresses. The same organism may cause one type of pneumonia in one patient, and another in a different patient.

Bronchopneumonia is usually a bacterial pneumonia rather than being caused by viral disease. It is more commonly a hospital-acquired pneumonia than a community-acquired pneumonia, in contrast to lobar pneumonia.

Bronchopneumonia is less likely than lobar pneumonia to be associated with "Streptococcus pneumoniae". Rather, the bronchopneumonia pattern has been associated mainly with the following: "Staphylococcus aureus", "Klebsiella", "E. coli" and "Pseudomonas".

Bronchopneumonia may sometimes be diagnosed after death, during autopsy.

Question:

Question related to image no. 26: A 90-year-old woman with a history of terminal stage Alzheimer's disease (Global Deterioration Scale 7), dependent on all basic activities of daily living, and occasional dysphagia to liquids. She comes to the emergency room due to presenting in the last few hours with hypoactive delirium, tachypnea, rhythmic tachycardia, and an axillary temperature of 37.3°C. The physical examination is difficult and does not provide any notable additional data. Given the chest X-ray shown, what is the most probable diagnosis? A - Pulmonary thromboembolism B - Acute pulmonary edema C - Acute interstitial pneumonia D - Acute bronchoalveolar pneumonia
