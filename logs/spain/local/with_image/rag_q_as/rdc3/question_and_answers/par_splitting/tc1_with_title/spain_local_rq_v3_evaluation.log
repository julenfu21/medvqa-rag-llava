Adamantinoma

Adamantinoma (from the Greek word "adamantinos", meaning "very hard") is a rare bone cancer, making up less than 1% of all bone cancers. It almost always occurs in the bones of the lower leg and involves both epithelial and osteofibrous tissue.

Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma

Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, previously malignant fibrous histiocytoma, is a type of cancer, namely a soft-tissue sarcoma.

Miriam Phoebe de Vos

Miriam Phoebe de Vos (26 November 1912 Zastron – 2005 Stellenbosch) was a leading South African botanist and academic. She was an expert on bulbous plants, especially "Romulea". She was also had a special interest in "Moraea" and "Clivia". 
She studied at the University of Stellenbosch and obtained her BSc ("cum laude") and MSc ("cum laude"). She held a junior lecture position from 1939 at the University of Cape Town.

RAG block for ANSWERS:

A answer context:

Granuloma faciale

Granuloma faciale is an uncommon benign chronic skin disease of unknown origin characterized by single or multiple cutaneous nodules, usually occurring over the face. Occasionally, extrafacial involvement is noted, most often on sun-exposed areas.

Granuloma

A granuloma is a structure formed during inflammation that is found in many diseases. It is a collection of immune cells known as macrophages. Granulomas form when the immune system attempts to wall off substances it perceives as foreign but is unable to eliminate. Such substances include infectious organisms including bacteria and fungi, as well as other materials such as foreign objects, keratin and suture fragments.

Eosinopenia

Eosinopenia is a form of agranulocytosis where the number of eosinophil granulocytes is lower than expected. Leukocytosis with eosinopenia can be a predictor of bacterial infection. It can be induced by stress reactions, Cushing's syndrome, or the use of steroids.<ref name="titleMonocytopenia/Eosinopenia/"></ref> Pathological causes include burns and acute infections.

B answer context:

Osteosarcoma

An osteosarcoma (OS) or osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) (or simply bone cancer) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid.

Bone metastasis

Bone metastases, or osseous metastatic disease, is a category of cancer metastases that results from primary tumor invasion to bone. Bone-originating primary tumors such as osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma are rare. Unlike hematological malignancies that originate in the blood and form non-solid tumors, bone metastases generally arise from epithelial tumors and form a solid mass inside the bone. Bone metastases cause severe pain, characterized by a dull, constant ache with periodic spikes of incident pain.
Under normal conditions, bone undergoes a continuous remodeling through osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone deposition. These processes are normally tightly regulated within bone to maintain bone structure and calcium homeostasis in the body. Disregulation of these processes by tumor cells leads to either osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions, reflective of the underlying mechanism of development. Typically, osteolytic metastases are more aggressive than osteoblastic metastases, which have a slower course. Regardless of the phenotype, though, bone metastases show osteoclast proliferation and hypertrophy.

Secondary malignant neoplasm

Secondary malignant neoplasm is a malignant tumor whose cause is the treatment (usually radiation or chemotherapy) which was used for a prior tumor. It must be distinguished from Metastasis

C answer context:

Lichenoid eruption

A lichenoid eruption is a skin disease characterized by damage and infiltration between the epidermis and dermis.

Dermatofibroma

A dermatofibroma, or benign fibrous histiocytomas, is a benign skin growth.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare tumor of the dermis layer of the skin, and is classified as a sarcoma. There is only about one case per million per year. DFSP is a fibrosarcoma, more precisely a cutaneous soft tissue sarcoma. In many respects, the disease behaves as a benign tumor, but in 2–5% of cases it can metastasize, so it should be considered to have malignant potential. It occurs most often in adults in their thirties; it has been described congenitally, in children, and the elderly. It accounts for approximately 2–6% of soft tissue sarcoma cancers.

D answer context:

Hiptage

Hiptage is a genus in the Malpighiaceae, a family of about 75 genera of flowering plants in the order Malpighiales. "Hiptage" comprises 30 (or more) species of vines and woody shrubs growing in forests of tropical southeastern Asia from Pakistan and India to Taiwan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The genus is distinctive in its three-winged samaras; most species bear an elongated commissural gland on the calyx.

Hypoparathyroidism

Hypoparathyroidism is decreased function of the parathyroid glands with underproduction of parathyroid hormone. This can lead to low levels of calcium in the blood, often causing cramping and twitching of muscles or tetany (involuntary muscle contraction), and several other symptoms. The condition can be inherited, but it is also encountered after thyroid or parathyroid gland surgery, and it can be caused by immune system-related damage as well as a number of rarer causes. The diagnosis is made with blood tests, and other investigations such as genetic testing depending on the results. The treatment of hypoparathyroidism is limited by the fact that there is no exact form of the hormone that can be administered as replacement. However teriparatide, brand name Forteo, a biosimilar peptide to parathyroid hormone, may be given by injection. Calcium replacement or vitamin D can ameliorate the symptoms but can increase the risk of kidney stones and chronic kidney disease.

Hipster PDA

The Hipster PDA is a paper-based personal organizer, popularized by Merlin Mann. Originally a tongue-in-cheek reaction to the increasing expense and complexity of personal digital assistants, the Hipster PDA (said to stand for "Parietal Disgorgement Aid" and often abbreviated to "hPDA") simply comprises a sheaf of index cards held together with a binder clip. Following widespread coverage in the media and blogs, the hPDA has become a popular personal management tool particularly with followers of David Allen's "Getting Things Done" methodology.
