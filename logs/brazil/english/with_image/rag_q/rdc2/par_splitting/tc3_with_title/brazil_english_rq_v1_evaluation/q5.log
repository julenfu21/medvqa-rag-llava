A 14-year-old female patient receives medical care due to macroscopic hematuria accompanied by mild myalgia, adynamia and mild hyperthermia (axillary temperature = 37.8°C). The mother informs that the patient had an upper airway infection about a month ago, which resolved after treatment with amoxicillin for seven days. At the time of this first consultation, the patient presents with arterial hypertension (Blood pressure = 150x110 mmHg), the fundus is normal and there are no other changes on the physical examination. The patient is hospitalized because the first laboratory tests already show elevated serum creatinine (8.4 mg/dL) and she quickly progresses to oligoanuria, edema and worsening renal function. The macroscopic hematuria regresses, but microscopic hematuria persists, with the presence of hematic casts and the patient also starts to present proteinuria (3g/24 h). Clinical-laboratory investigation does not show the presence of vasculitis or systemic disease. Serum complement dosage (C3, CH50) is normal; antinuclear antibodies absent, negative antinuclear factor test. The patient underwent a renal biopsy - a fragment with 30 glomeruli, with proliferation of Bownan's capsule epithelial cells and infiltration by macrophages and lymphocytes, configuring the presence of epithelial crescents in 70% of the glomeruli, some with a fibrocellular appearance. The immunofluorescence of the renal biopsy, reproduced below, shows linear deposition of IgG - there are no mesangial deposits; Negative immunofluorescence for IgM, IgA and C3. Based on the clinical history, evolution and renal biopsy and immunofluorescence, the question is what is the mechanism responsible for glomerular damage?  A - In situ antigen-antibody reaction along the glomerular basement membrane. B - Deposition of circulating immune complexes along the glomerular basement membrane. C - Changes in cellular immunity, notably macrophages and T helper lymphocytes. D - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antigen antibody deposition.

Hematuria

Hematuria (American English) or haematuria (British English), also called erythrocyturia, is a clinical sign. It is defined by the presence of blood or red blood cells in the urine. An anatomical framework is helpful in developing a comprehensive differential diagnosis. Blood or red blood cells can enter and mix with urine at multiple anatomical sites. These include the urinary system, female reproductive system, and integumentary system.

Urinary causes occur anywhere between the kidney glomerulus and the urethral meatus. These can be divided into glomerular and non-glomerular causes. Non-glomerular causes can be further subdivided into upper urinary tract and lower urinary tract causes.

After conducting a thorough history and physical examination, further medical testing is warranted. Patients can be stratified into high and low risk. High risk patients include those with visible hematuria or those with non-visible hematuria and risk factors. A complete evaluation of the urinary tract is indicated for hematuria. This includes imaging of the upper urinary tract and cystoscopy of the lower urinary tract.

Nephrotic syndrome

Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of symptoms due to kidney damage. This includes protein in the urine, low blood albumin levels, high blood lipids, and significant swelling. Other symptoms may include weight gain, feeling tired, and foamy urine. Complications may include blood clots, infections, and high blood pressure.
Causes include a number of kidney diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and minimal change disease. It may also occur as a complication of diabetes or lupus. The underlying mechanism typically involves damage to the glomeruli of the kidney. Diagnosis is typically based on urine testing and sometimes a kidney biopsy. It differs from nephritic syndrome in that there are no red blood cells in the urine.
Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Other efforts include managing high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and infection risk. A low salt diet and limiting fluids is often recommended. About 5 per 100,000 people are affected per year. The usual underlying cause varies between children and adults.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by large amounts of proteinuria (>3.5 g per 1.73 m body surface area per day, or > 40 mg per square meter body surface area per hour in children), hypoalbuminemia (< 2.5 g/dl), hyperlipidaemia, and edema that begins in the face. Lipiduria (lipids in urine) can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Hyponatremia also occurs with a low fractional sodium excretion.

Hyperlipidaemia is caused by two factors:
BULLET::::- Hypoproteinemia stimulates protein synthesis in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of lipoproteins.
BULLET::::- Lipid catabolism is decreased due to lower levels of lipoprotein lipase, the main enzyme involved in lipoprotein breakdown. Cofactors, such as apolipoprotein C2 may also be lost by increased filtration of proteins.
