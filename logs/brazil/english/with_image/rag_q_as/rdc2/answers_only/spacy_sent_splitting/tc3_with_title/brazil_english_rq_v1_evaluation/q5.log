A 14-year-old female patient receives medical care due to macroscopic hematuria accompanied by mild myalgia, adynamia and mild hyperthermia (axillary temperature = 37.8Â°C). The mother informs that the patient had an upper airway infection about a month ago, which resolved after treatment with amoxicillin for seven days. At the time of this first consultation, the patient presents with arterial hypertension (Blood pressure = 150x110 mmHg), the fundus is normal and there are no other changes on the physical examination. The patient is hospitalized because the first laboratory tests already show elevated serum creatinine (8.4 mg/dL) and she quickly progresses to oligoanuria, edema and worsening renal function. The macroscopic hematuria regresses, but microscopic hematuria persists, with the presence of hematic casts and the patient also starts to present proteinuria (3g/24 h). Clinical-laboratory investigation does not show the presence of vasculitis or systemic disease. Serum complement dosage (C3, CH50) is normal; antinuclear antibodies absent, negative antinuclear factor test. The patient underwent a renal biopsy - a fragment with 30 glomeruli, with proliferation of Bownan's capsule epithelial cells and infiltration by macrophages and lymphocytes, configuring the presence of epithelial crescents in 70% of the glomeruli, some with a fibrocellular appearance. The immunofluorescence of the renal biopsy, reproduced below, shows linear deposition of IgG - there are no mesangial deposits; Negative immunofluorescence for IgM, IgA and C3. Based on the clinical history, evolution and renal biopsy and immunofluorescence, the question is what is the mechanism responsible for glomerular damage?  A - In situ antigen-antibody reaction along the glomerular basement membrane. B - Deposition of circulating immune complexes along the glomerular basement membrane. C - Changes in cellular immunity, notably macrophages and T helper lymphocytes. D - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antigen antibody deposition.

RAG block for ANSWERS:

A answer context:

Glomerular basement membrane

The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) of the kidney is the basal lamina layer of the glomerulus. The glomerular endothelial cells, the GBM and the filtration slits between the podocytes perform the filtration function of the glomerulus, separating the blood in the capillaries from the filtrate that forms in Bowman's capsule. The GBM is a fusion of the endothelial cell and podocyte basal laminas.

Lupus band test

Lupus band test is done upon skin biopsy, with direct immunofluorescence staining, in which, if positive, IgG and complement depositions are found at the dermoepidermal junction. This test can be helpful in distinguishing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from cutaneous lupus, because in SLE the lupus band test will be positive in both involved and uninvolved skin, whereas with cutaneous lupus only the involved skin will be positive. The minimum criteria for positivity are:

The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) of the kidney is the basal lamina layer of the glomerulus. The glomerular endothelial cells, the GBM and the filtration slits between the podocytes perform the filtration function of the glomerulus, separating the blood in the capillaries from the filtrate that forms in Bowman's capsule. The GBM is a fusion of the endothelial cell and podocyte basal laminas.

Lupus nephritis

Lupus nephritis is an inflammation of the kidneys caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease. It is a type of glomerulonephritis in which the glomeruli become inflamed. As the result of SLE, the cause of glomerulonephritis is said to be "secondary" and has a different pattern and outcome from conditions with a "primary" cause originating in the kidney.

C answer context:

Immune response

The Immune response is the body's response caused by its immune system being activated by antigens. The immune response can include immunity to pathogenic microorganisms and its products, allergies, graft rejections, as well as autoimmunity to self-antigens. In this process the main cells involved are T cells and B cells (sub-types of lymphocytes), and macrophages (a type of leucocyte or white blood cell).

Lymphocyte

A lymphocyte is one of the subtypes of a white blood cell in a vertebrate's immune system. Lymphocytes include natural killer cells (which function in cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity), T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity), and B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity). They are the main type of cell found in lymph, which prompted the name "lymphocyte".

D answer context:

C-ANCA

c-ANCAs, or PR3-ANCA, or Cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, are a type of autoantibody, an antibody produced by the body that acts against one of its own proteins. These antibodies show a diffusely granular, cytoplasmic staining pattern under microscopy. This pattern results from binding of ANCAs to antigen targets throughout the neutrophil cytoplasm, the most common protein target being proteinase 3 (PR3).

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) are a group of autoantibodies, mainly of the IgG type, against antigens in the cytoplasm of neutrophil granulocytes (the most common type of white blood cell) and monocytes. They are detected as a blood test in a number of autoimmune disorders, but are particularly associated with systemic vasculitis, so called ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV). Immunofluorescence (IF) on ethanol-fixed neutrophils is used to detect ANCA, although formalin-fixed neutrophils may be used to help differentiate ANCA patterns.
