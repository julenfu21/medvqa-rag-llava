A 14-year-old female patient receives medical care due to macroscopic hematuria accompanied by mild myalgia, adynamia and mild hyperthermia (axillary temperature = 37.8Â°C). The mother informs that the patient had an upper airway infection about a month ago, which resolved after treatment with amoxicillin for seven days. At the time of this first consultation, the patient presents with arterial hypertension (Blood pressure = 150x110 mmHg), the fundus is normal and there are no other changes on the physical examination. The patient is hospitalized because the first laboratory tests already show elevated serum creatinine (8.4 mg/dL) and she quickly progresses to oligoanuria, edema and worsening renal function. The macroscopic hematuria regresses, but microscopic hematuria persists, with the presence of hematic casts and the patient also starts to present proteinuria (3g/24 h). Clinical-laboratory investigation does not show the presence of vasculitis or systemic disease. Serum complement dosage (C3, CH50) is normal; antinuclear antibodies absent, negative antinuclear factor test. The patient underwent a renal biopsy - a fragment with 30 glomeruli, with proliferation of Bownan's capsule epithelial cells and infiltration by macrophages and lymphocytes, configuring the presence of epithelial crescents in 70% of the glomeruli, some with a fibrocellular appearance. The immunofluorescence of the renal biopsy, reproduced below, shows linear deposition of IgG - there are no mesangial deposits; Negative immunofluorescence for IgM, IgA and C3. Based on the clinical history, evolution and renal biopsy and immunofluorescence, the question is what is the mechanism responsible for glomerular damage?  A - In situ antigen-antibody reaction along the glomerular basement membrane. B - Deposition of circulating immune complexes along the glomerular basement membrane. C - Changes in cellular immunity, notably macrophages and T helper lymphocytes. D - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antigen antibody deposition.
