Elevated transaminases

In medicine, the presence of elevated transaminases, commonly the transaminases alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), may be an indicator of liver damage. Other terms employed include transaminasemia, transaminitis (which some sources consider pathologically meaningless) and elevated liver enzymes (though they are not the only enzymes in the liver).
